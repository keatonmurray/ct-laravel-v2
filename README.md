### 📋 Core Requirements (as per instructions)
- A responsive form to input:
  - **Product Name**
  - **Quantity in Stock**

- The data is displayed below the form in rows, including:
  - Product Name
  - Quantity
  - Price per Item
  - Date Submitted (formatted)
  - Total Value (Quantity × Price)
- The last row displays the **sum total** of all product values.
- All form submissions and updates are handled via **AJAX**.
- UI styled using **Bootstrap 5**.

## 💡 Developer's Note

I'm not yet an experienced Laravel developer in a production environment, but I hope the extra functionalities I added demonstrate how I make up for those gaps:

- I aim for clean and intuitive UI/UX
- I strive to fully implement features end-to-end
- I proactively go beyond requirements to add polish
- I’m open to feedback and eager to grow

This project is my way of showing how I approach problems, learn by doing, and adapt quickly to unfamiliar tools or environments.
